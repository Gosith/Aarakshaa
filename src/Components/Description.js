          Aarakshaa.. Aarakshaa means “PROTECTION”in Sinhalese [or in Sri Lankan]. The idea is to protect everything what you think is important for you and your family. Most of us have three main dreams in everyone’s life, Firstly, to give a good education to kids and make them good citizens of New Zealand, Secondly, to buy a decent house to live with your loved ones and Finally, to retire with a solid bank balance. We at AARAKSHAA committed to help you achieve all those dreams with realistic plans.
