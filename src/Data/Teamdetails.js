After coming here I did a Diploma in Valuation and Property Management from Lincoln University and completed the Real Estate Qualification and Level 5 qualifications in Life and Health Insurance, Investments and Residential Lending. I got a great exposure to Kiwi Culture while I was working in a service station for over 4 years in Lincoln and accidentally moved to Insurance Industry as my wife was about to lose her job. Somethings happens for a reason aye…but you only know later on in your life. “Don’t think of selling Insurance to Sri Lankans” was my first lesson from my first manager [Please don’t ask who and I will not tell ha ha ha…] but I went completely opposite direction and start getting to Sri Lankan market as I felt my fellow Sri Lankans need more support when understanding fine prints of Insurance and when selecting the best cover for the money they can afford.",
